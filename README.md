# CodonAnalyzer
 
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/bibymaths/codonanalyzer)

A modular Snakemake workflow for analyzing codon usage, extracting ORFs, translating sequences to protein, and computing + plotting hydropathy profiles.

Originally developed using Perl in 2015, this pipeline has been modernized in 2025 with reproducibility and modularity in mind.

## Features

- Codon usage statistics and GC content
- Longest ORF extraction
- Protein sequence translation
- Hydropathy calculation (Kyteâ€“Doolittle)
- Plotting via Python + Matplotlib
- Configurable via `config.yaml`
- Reproducible workflow using Snakemake

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codonanalyzer.git
cd codonanalyzer
``` 
### Setup Environment 

```bash 
conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda snakemake-minimal matplotlib numpy=2.0
```  

or using environment.yml: 

```bash 
conda env create -f environment.yml 
``` 

Then, run:

```bash
snakemake --cores 4
```
