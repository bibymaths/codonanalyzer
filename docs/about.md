# About

**CodonAnalyzer** is a modular bioinformatics pipeline originally developed as a Perl project in 2015 at JUIT, India, as part of their 6th-semester coursework in *Programming Languages for Bioinformatics*.

The current version (2025) modernizes, and integrates the original Perl tools using the Snakemake workflow system. It adds standardized outputs, a configuration-driven design, Python-based plotting, and support for reproducible research environments.

This evolution reflects the principles of modern scientific programming — reproducibility, modularity, and transparency — while honoring its academic roots.
